            <h2>Artist</h2>
            <p className="text">
              Kieran is a Theatre graduate of the University of Victoria, where he specialized in
              acting, directing, and applied theatre. Kieran&apos;s work as a director is focused on
              ensemble-based creation, typically in an immersive environment. In Woyzeck Experiment,
              Kieran used the source text from Georg Buchner&apos;s text to facilitate the creation
              of an immersive movement piece devised by the performers. Soon after on an exchange to
              Bangkok University, Kieran explored the history of Thai Democracy through the creation
              of Ghostlight, a children&apos;s style reinterpretation of historical events lit only
              by the flashlights of the performers/audience. The show was performed entirely in
              Thai. Most recently, Kieran co-directed <em>Are We All Dead?</em>, a performance piece
              using theatre strategies from 1930&apos;s Canadian agit-prop to address the climate
              crisis.
            </p>
            <p className="text">
              Kieran is not only an international director/performer but is an arts administrator as
              well. Most recently Kieran worked as the Managing Producer of Theatre SKAM&apos;s
              Pop-Up Theatre in Victoria, BC. He then worked for Geordie Theatre as their Associate
              Producer for several years.

            <p>
              Kieran isn&apos;t just a coder and artist, he&apos;s also a backcountry camper! On his
              blog Backpacking Boi, Kieran reviews trails and equipment for backcountry camping and
              other outdoor sports. He loves surfing, rock climbing, bouldering and cross-country
              skiing too. In 2022, he was awarded the Gold Duke of Edinburgh&apos;s Award, an
              international award for outdoor activity, volunteer service, physical activity and
              self-improvement.
